## Resume

A simple, modern, one-page tech or software engineer resume template in LaTeX, in Lato font.

It's worked well for me when applying to both small and large tech companies. For simplicity, I've kept the sample resume to one page and the source code to one `resume.tex` file.

* About: phone number, email address, GitHub profile, and LinkedIn profile, spaced evenly across the line.
* Experience: list out your work and other experience.
* Skills: list out programming languages, software and platforms you've used.
* Education: list out your college and degrees.

## Usage

### Overleaf

1. Create a new project in Overleaf 
2. Copy `resume.tex` into your project.
3. Edit `resume.tex` with your information.
4. Click `Recompile` and download your generated PDF.

I currently use Overleaf for my resumes since it manages all the dependent packages. If you'd like to compile it locally, please follow instructions for installing your LaTeX environment and any dependencies.

## Sample Resume

Please see the link below for the sample resume PDF generated by the `.tex` code. It has most of actual resume in it:

## Future Enhancements

I'm planning to add some enhancements in the future:

1. Guide for compiling this locally
2. CircleCI automation to ensure the `.tex` compiles
3. Add LaTeX macros to make it easier to update the resume
