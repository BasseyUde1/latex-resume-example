# Resume

A simple, modern, one-page tech or software engineer resume template in LaTeX, in Lato font.

It's worked well for me when applying to both small and large tech companies. For simplicity, I've kept the sample resume to one page and the source code to one `resume.tex` file.

* About: phone number, email address, GitHub profile, and LinkedIn profile, spaced evenly across the line.
* Experience: list out your work and other experience.
* Skills: list out programming languages, software and platforms you've used.
* Education: list out your college and degrees.

# Compiling

I currently use Overleaf to compile it into a PDF.
